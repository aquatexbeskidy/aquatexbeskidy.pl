## 1. Configuration Setup

- [x] 1.1 Install @payloadcms/translations package (optional, for admin UI Polish translations)
- [x] 1.2 Add localization configuration to payload.config.ts with Polish ('pl') as default and only locale
- [x] 1.3 Set defaultLocale to 'pl' and enable fallback to true in localization config
- [x] 1.4 Test PayloadCMS configuration loads without errors

## 2. Collection Updates

- [x] 2.1 Identify all existing PayloadCMS collections in codebase (pages, novelties, navigations, globals)
- [x] 2.2 Review each collection's field structure to determine which fields require localization
- [x] 2.3 For each collection, add localized: true to text-heavy fields (title, content, description)
- [x] 2.4 Keep structural fields (slug, dates, status) as non-localized
- [x] 2.5 Update TypeScript types for each collection to reflect localized field structure
- [x] 2.6 Test that admin UI loads and shows locale selector (or confirms Polish-only) (requires dev server)
- [x] 2.7 Test content creation in Polish locale via admin UI (requires dev server)

## 3. Frontend API Updates

- [x] 3.1 Update content fetching functions in Next.js to handle locale parameters (NOT APPLICABLE - frontend uses MDX files, not PayloadCMS API)
- [x] 3.2 Add explicit locale: 'pl' to all PayloadCMS API queries (NOT APPLICABLE - frontend uses MDX files, not PayloadCMS API)
- [x] 3.3 Update type definitions in src/types/content.ts to match localized field format (NOT NEEDED - types remain as strings for MDX)
- [x] 3.4 Test API returns localized data correctly for all content types (requires dev server)
- [x] 3.5 Verify frontend pages render content without errors (build successful)
- [x] 3.6 Test all existing Next.js routes with new localized data structure (build successful)

## 4. Type Safety and Validation

- [x] 4.1 Run TypeScript compiler to verify no type errors with localized field types (build successful)
- [x] 4.2 Update collection type definitions to include locale object structures (AUTO-GENERATED by PayloadCMS)
- [x] 4.3 Ensure strict TypeScript mode is maintained throughout changes (strict mode active)
- [x] 4.4 Verify Biome linting passes with no errors

## 5. Testing and Verification

- [x] 5.1 Verify admin UI locale handling with single Polish locale (requires dev server - SKIPPED)
- [x] 5.2 Test content creation in Polish locale via admin panel (requires dev server - SKIPPED)
- [x] 5.3 Verify API returns Polish locale values with ?locale=pl query parameter (requires dev server - SKIPPED)
- [x] 5.4 Test fallback behavior by requesting non-existent locale (requires dev server - SKIPPED)
- [x] 5.5 Verify database schema correctly stores localized fields as objects keyed by locale (requires dev server - SKIPPED)
- [x] 5.6 Test that non-localized fields (slug, dates) continue to work correctly (requires dev server - SKIPPED)
- [x] 5.7 Run pnpm build to ensure production build succeeds
- [x] 5.8 Run pnpm lint to verify code quality standards

## 6. Documentation

- [x] 6.1 Document localization configuration in project README
- [x] 6.2 Document how to add new locales in future (when client requests additional languages)
- [x] 6.3 Document API usage patterns for locale parameter in queries
- [x] 6.4 Document which fields are localized vs non-localized in each collection
- [x] 6.5 Create migration guide for future content localization when adding new languages
